- 👋 Hi, I’m @TeacherArea
- 👀 I’m interested in life: music, history philosophy, art, litterature. I have IT as a full time paid side job from that :D
- 🌱 I am currently working as a teacher in a senior high school and have more than 10 years of teaching experience. Previously, I taught web development at a university of applied sciences.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to see my students collaborate on all sorts of projects.
